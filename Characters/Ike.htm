					<h2>Ike</h2>
					<p>Ike starred in two Fire Emblem games, one for Gamecube and one for Wii: Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance and Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn.</p>
					<img/>
					<p>Unlike most other Fire Emblem protagonists, Ike did not come from royalty. His father was the leader of a group of mercenaries. After his father died, Ike took up the mantle with a rocky start. He was young and inexperienced at leading, but he had a courageous heart. By the end of his first game, he becomes a revolutionary leader that many trust in.</p>
					<img/>
					<p>In Smash, Ike wields a greatsword and often one handed. He’s a powerhouse, but that strength comes with a cost. He’s one of the slowest characters in the game, his recovery is extremely exploitable, and unlike other power characters he doesn’t have any moves that are great for pressuring shields nor is he blessed with any super armor. Instead Ike must depend on a few surprisingly fast aerials along with grabs to force his opponents into 50/50 situations against his more powerful attacks. And if an opponent thinks that they can get away without shielding or dodging much against him, they’ll soon be facing a well-timed Smash Attack.</p>
					<img/>
					<p>Ike’s entire gameplan is about zoning. Because of his low speed he must use his range to compensate until he can take out his opponents. His moves are often unsafe, but can scare and bully opponents into situations that are favorable for him. At the end of the day, a player using Ike must have the guts to go in and make things happen.</p>
