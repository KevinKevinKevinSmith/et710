					<h2>Charizard</h2>
					<p>Charizard is a Pokemon from the series Pokemon.</p>

					<p>Charizard is one of the most famous Pokemon from the mega franchise that is Pokemon. The franchise is founded on a relatively simple RPG system with a decent amount of depth and a large amount of breadth. He was on the cover of one of the first games, and in the most recent generation they added two temporary evolutions for him, one of which he uses in this Smash as his Final Smash. Virtually all of his moves (along with every other playable Pokemon) comes from some move in the actual Pokemon games.</p>

					<p>In Smash, Charizard is a powerhouse. He has Rock Smash as his down special, which gives him super armor and punishes people trying to spot dodge or juggle him. He has Flare Blitz as his side special, a self-damaging move with super armor that can be used to catch opponents dashing or rolling away. He has Fly as his up special, a short recovery move with super armor that also doubles as a kill move or way to counter edge guarding opponents. Despite all the super armor he isn’t as heavy as you’d hope, so don’t constantly throw out his big attacks unless you want to be punished. Even though his attacks ask him to be in danger, he has trouble getting through shields at times. Thankfully, his grab range is decent, his throws damaging, and he even gets a kill option at high percents.</p>

					<p>Charizard is an above average weight brawler. He has claws and fangs that want to be in on the fight. His up smash uses his wings and they have invulnerability during the attack. His tail is used in some moves and even has a sweet spot at the fiery tip. Charizard is great at cracking an opponent’s defenses and giving them massive damage. And when you finally rack their damage high enough, grab them and use a down throw!</p>
