					<h2>Wii Fit Trainer</h2>
					<p>The Wii Fit Trainers, male and female, are the virtual trainers from Nintendo’s Wii Fit series of exercise software.</p>
					<img src="https://asset1.basecamp.com/2791912/projects/8068241/attachments/130950803/f9bad47309f7932d525dd6493790adfd0010/thumbnail.jpg"/>
					<p>The Wii Fit Trainers represent much of Nintendo’s philosophy during the Wii era of software. Wii Fit was a piece of software that was less a game and more an exercise companion. It added some of the trappings of gaming like using your weight as your high score, and challenging you to complete various exercises and burn more calories each day. Each game included various yoga, aerobic, and anaerobic exercises that could be lead by your choice of trainer as you followed along.</p>

					<p>In Smash, Wii Fit Trainer uses the poses from those various yoga poses and exercises as actual attacks in the game. The Warrior, the Tree, and the Arm and Leg Lift are just their Smash attacks. In addition, they have Special Attacks that are just a bit out there but fit with their odd characterization. The Sun Salutation creates an actual sun-like projectile that charges up and can be fired. Their recovery takes the form of a number of hula hoops they spin around themselves, propelling themselves upward like a helicopter. Wii Fit Trainer is a fun and silly character that very literally takes their moveset from their source material.</p>

					<p>Wii Fit Trainer is an average weight brawler with an interesting twist. The character can create “mixups” with many of their attacks because they hit both in front and behind them. Along with a decent run speed and extremely quick dodges, Wii Fit Trainer is good at getting in and staying in. Against opponents that wisely shield, she has slightly extra grab range she can take advantage of, along with a kill throw at extremely high percents. Deep Breathing, their down special, can be hard to use in the heat of battle but getting it off gives you a temporary attack boost, making it easier to close out a stock early. Using the character can feel like an uphill battle at times, but keep a clear head and stay unpredictable, and you’ll find yourself easily on top.</p>
