					<h2>Link</h2>
					<p>Link is the star character from The Legend of Zelda series, a series known for producing its game covers with gold colors.</p>
					<img src="https://asset1.basecamp.com/2791912/projects/8068241/attachments/130950799/75521d96a89923beb8b5d126dc69fc9b0010/thumbnail.png"/>

					<p>Link is known as the Hero of Time, a hero that appears whenever the forces of darkness, often led by long time series antagonist Ganondorf, gain too much of a foothold across the land of Hyrule. The series started with the ideas of carving your way through a hostile land and plumbing the depths of deadly dungeons, but has since become a lot more story driven and puzzle focused in recent releases.</p>
					<img src="http://www.smashbros.com/images/character/link/screen-1.jpg"/>
					<p>In Smash, Link has various weapons that appear in a majority of his games. His bow and arrow is surprisingly powerful and great to use as a ranged poke, his bombs provide multi directional pressure, and his boomerang acts as a quick ranged jab that can anti-air or even pull enemies in. Along with all of that, Link also carries the Master Sword, which can cause a surprising amount of damage and knockback. His forward smash has a second hit, his up special whirlwind can be charged on the ground, and his dash attack can even kill early if you land it with the tip of the sword. Use projectiles to trip up approaching enemies while giving the real damage through your sword.</p>

					<p>Link is an average to heavy weight projectile character. He doesnâ€™t play keepaway thanks to the power of his sword, and instead uses his projectiles to find openings for him to use it. Unfortunately, his recovery is on the weaker side to compensate for all of this power, but he can hold onto bombs while recovering until they explode for a bomb jump, or even hit the grab button to release his hookshot to reach ledge horizontally. Link is almost a rushdown character gifted with projectiles so that he can hit opponents at any range, and the fact that many of his sword attacks are kill moves means you should never give your opponent any quarter.</p>
