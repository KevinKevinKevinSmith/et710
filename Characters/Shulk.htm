					<h2>Shulk</h2>
					<p>Shulk is from a game called Xenoblade Chronicles, an RPG that released during the twilight years of the Wii’s software output.</p>
					<img/>
					<p>Shulk is an engineer researching the Monado, the same weapon he wields in Smash. In studying the Monado, and slowly unlocking its powers, he gains unparalleled ability to control the pace of battle.</p>
					<img/>
					<p>In Smash, this translates into using the Monado Arts to radically alter his stats, forcing a change in the way opponents must deal with him. The Jump Art provides him with a green glow and increases his jump and recovery height. The Speed Art clads his body with blue and gives him a running speed to rival Sonic. The Shield Art lowers the damage he takes from attacks while the Buster Art does the opposite, but both artes share the same effect on Shulk’s attacks. Finally, the Smash Art makes temporarily makes him one of the lightest characters in the game, while providing him with unparalleled knockback ability. As an engineer, Shulk is a slightly technical character.</p>
					<img/>
					<p>As a zoning character, Shulk is blessed with range that he can use to catch opponents on the run and keep them away as they approach. Especially with his aerials, Shulk can use the Monado in his attacks to cover his body at angles different from other characters of this type. Combined with his Monado Arts, he can easily and often catch opponents off guard, while working towards his win. </p>
