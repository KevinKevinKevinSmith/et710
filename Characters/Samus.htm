					<h2>Samus Aran</h2>
					<p>Samus Aran is the main character from the Metroid series, a series known for putting the player on alien planets, fighting various monsters and figuring out clever secrets.</p>
					<img src="https://asset1.basecamp.com/2791912/projects/8068241/attachments/130950808/008e009b063c6a135dfd5bbf34c9e4400010/thumbnail.jpg"/>

					<p>The series is famous for starring a female character but not giving any hints towards this fact until after you finish one of its games, and only if you do well enough too. Samus is a bounty hunter that mostly takes jobs from the Galactic Federation. She uses a power suit gifted to her by an alien race that saved her after she and her family were attacked by Space Pirates. She was the only survivor, and after gaining the power suit and becoming proficient with it, she gladly accepted work that would help push back the galactic threat the Space Pirates represented. The franchise is beloved and only has one major mark against it, the critically panned Metroid: Other M.</p>

					<p>In Smash, Samus is equipped with the two of the attacks she’s most famous for, her missiles and her Charge Beam. Missiles come in two varieties, homing and super, while the Charge Beam needs time to fully charge before it becomes a high damaging, easy killing, and sometimes shield breaking attack option. To compensate for these ranged advantages, she has relatively slow physical attacks that she must have space to get out in time but at least carry a bit of zoning range. She also has recovery options with her morph ball bombs when she’s falling from above, her screw attack when she’s recovering from below, and her grappling beam on her grab button when she’s reaching out to the ledge from the side.</p>

					<p>Samus is a relatively heavy projectile character, but she shouldn’t be played pure keepaway. Her close combat abilities are overall on the slow side, and she has the slowest side roll in the game. If a foe gets in on her, she needs to time her attacks and fight back. When she has space, she can charge her Charge Beam or poke with uncharged and missile shots. When an opponent is caught by one and sent reeling, she can charge in with her dash attack, juggle with an aerial, or do a poke with her grapple beam. Her grapple beam doubles as a ranged grab, so any zoning character thinking they can safely poke at her shield can be easily punished. To many in the galaxy Samus is a hero, so play smart and not cowardly.</p>
